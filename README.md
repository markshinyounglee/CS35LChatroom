# CS35LChatroom
I created this to make prototypes of my chatroom before incorporating it into our project. 

These are the core features I am thinking about:
- There are two view modes: audience mode and beef mode
- When the user enters into beef channel in which he/she is an audience, they cannot type any chat but they can view all the chat history.
Also, they can vote up and down to show their support or disapproval. Optionally, there can also be a leave button.
- When the user enters into channel where he/she is a player, they can type chats to the opponent as many times as they want. 
There are two buttons for players: create poll and bail. They can make a poll where people can vote if he/she makes a poll.
If they press the bail button, the chatroom is archived and would still be visible in general search tab.
